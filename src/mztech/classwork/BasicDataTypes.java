    /* float vs decimal : Float stores an approximate value and decimal stores an exact value.
    In summary, exact values like money should use decimal, and approximate values like scientific measurements should use float.
    When multiplying a non integer and dividing by that same number, decimals lose precision while floats do not.

    Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. The four access levels are âˆ’

    Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.
    Visible to the class only (private).
    Visible to the world (public).
    Visible to the package and all subclasses (protected).

    /*
    Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionality.

The static modifier for creating class methods and variables.

The final modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.

The abstract modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.

The synchronized and volatile modifiers, which are used for threads.
